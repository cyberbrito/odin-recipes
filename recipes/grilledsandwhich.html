    <h3>All American Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h3>
    <p>You will never cook another grilled cheese sandwich again after you try this one! Itâ€™s deliciously cheesy on the inside, and once you sink your teeth 
        into that crispy outside, it is absolute perfection</p>
    <p><strong> Sandwhich </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>8 slices bread (your choice)</li>
        <li> slices organic, american or cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups herbs roasted tomatos</li>
        <li>6-8 cooked bacon strips, roughly chopped</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong> Herb Butter</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li> 4 Tbsps unsalted butter, softened at room temp</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<p> <strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <li>On the outsides of each bread slice, spread 
        a bit of the herb butter so that they become
         nicely crisp and golden.</li>
    <li>On one side of 4 slices of bread, add a spoonful of pesto sauce (if using) spreading evenly until covered followed a handful of chopped bacon and herb roasted tomatoes. On the other half of each sandwich (atop remaining 4 slices), add 2 slices of cheese. Place together one side of bread that has cheese with the other side that has the pesto-bacon mixture,
         pressing them gently together to make a sandwich. Repeat until all sandwiches were made.</li>
    <li> In a large skillet (12-inch) over medium-high heat, add two sandwiches (one side down), cooking until golden brown and the cheese has melted, about 3-4 minutes. Flip sandwich unto opposite side and cook from another 3-4 minutes. NOTE: The Everything 
        bagel seasoning should be "set" into the sandwiches at this point if you're using it.</li>
    <li>Once done, cut in halves (if desired), plate the sandwiches with your favorite side or chips and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
